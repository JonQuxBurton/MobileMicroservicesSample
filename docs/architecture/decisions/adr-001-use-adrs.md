# Architecture Decision Record: Use ADRs

## Context

We want to think deeply about all our architectural decisions, exploring all alternatives and making a careful, considered, well-researched choice.
We want to be as transparent as possible in our decision-making process.
We don't want decisions to be made unilaterally in a vacuum. Specifically, we want to give our steering group the opportunity to review every major decision.
Despite being a geographically and temporally distributed team, we want our contributors to have a strong shared understanding of the technical rationale behind decisions.
We want to be able to revisit prior decisions to determine fairly if they still make sense, and if the motivating circumstances or conditions have changed.


## Decision

We will document every architecture-level decision for Arachne and its core modules with an Architecture Decision Record. These are a well structured, relatively lightweight way to capture architectural proposals. They can serve as an artifact for discussion, and remain as an enduring record of the context and motivation of past decisions.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

Developers must write an ADR and submit it for review before selecting an approach to any architectural decision -- that is, any decision that affects the way Arachne or an Arachne application is put together at a high level.
We will have a concrete artifact around which to focus discussion, before finalizing decisions.
If we follow the process, decisions will be made deliberately, as a group.
The master branch of our repositories will reflect the high-level consensus of the steering group.
We will have a useful persistent record of why the system is the way it is.
